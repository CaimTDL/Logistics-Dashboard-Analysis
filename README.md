# Logistics Dashboard Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involved the redesign and analysis of a logistics dashboard. The primary goal was to deconstruct an existing dashboard, identify its errors, and rebuild a more efficient and insightful version. The new dashboard provides comprehensive insights into delivery performance, offering actionable data for decision-making.

## Objectives
1. Deconstruct the existing dashboard and identify design and analytical errors.
2. Display the **Total Deliveries on Time by Delivery Channel**.
3. Show the **Percentage of Early Deliveries by Delivery Team**.
4. Analyze the **Total Deliveries per Month**.
5. Highlight the **Total Deliveries of Products by the Top 5 Sellers**.
6. Present the **Total Late Deliveries by City**.
7. Provide the **Percentage of Deliveries by Delivery Status** (e.g., On Time, Early, Delayed).

## Key Features of the New Dashboard
- **Improved Data Visualization**: Clear, concise, and visually appealing representation of logistics data.
- **Enhanced Insights**: Focused metrics to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement in delivery performance.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplified layout for better understanding and accessibility.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: To create calculated fields and enhance the analytical depth.
